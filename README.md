# Natural Language Processing - Language-Translation
Machine Translation Model which learns to translate English sentences into German Sentences. This is carried out using **seq2seq** Model ie **Encoder-Decoder** model with **LSTM Units**. Only ***Python Libraries*** are used to implement entire model to better understand the mathematics behind working of Recurrent Neural Networks.

Given below is an example of **seq2seq** Model Architecture
